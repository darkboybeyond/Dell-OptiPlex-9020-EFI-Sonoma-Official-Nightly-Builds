- 🔧 **Motherboard Chipset:** Intel Q87 Express Chipset
- 🎨 **Video Adapter:** Intel HD Graphics 4600 (2048 MB)

🔊 **Audio Adapter:**
- Realtek ALC3220 @ Intel Lynx Point PCH - High Definition Audio Controller

🌐 **Network Adapter:**
- Intel I217-LM Gigabit Network Connection

🔌 **USB Device:**

## ⚙️ Performance and Stability:

Despite its age, the Dell OptiPlex 9020 runs MacOS Sonoma seamlessly. Here are some highlights of the performance:

- **Graphics:** The Intel HD Graphics 4600 handles the macOS interface smoothly, providing a good user experience without any graphical glitches.

- **Network:** Wired connections are stable and reliable, courtesy of the Intel network adapter.
- **USB:** The USB 3.0 ports function without issues, ensuring full peripheral compatibility.

## 🛠️ Installation Process:

The installation was straightforward, thanks to the robust EFI configuration and available guides. Key steps included:

- 💾 **Creating a Bootable USB Installer:** Used a Mac or another Hackintosh to create a bootable USB with MacOS Sonoma.
- 🔧 **Configuring the BIOS:** Ensured BIOS settings were optimized for macOS compatibility (e.g., disabling Secure Boot, enabling AHCI).
- 📁 **EFI Folder Configuration:** Placed the necessary kexts, drivers, and configuration files in the EFI folder.
- 💻 **Installing MacOS:** Booted from the USB installer, formatted the drive to APFS, and installed MacOS Sonoma.
- 🛠️ **Post-Installation Tweaks:** Applied post-installation tweaks to ensure all hardware components were recognized and functional.

## 🗂️ EFI Configuration and Support:

I am excited to announce that I will be **providing nightly builds for the EFI folders**, ensuring they are up-to-date and optimized for the best performance. Additionally, **I will be offering support to assist with any issues or questions you may have**.

### Here's a snapshot of the key components in my EFI folder:
